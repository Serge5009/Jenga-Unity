# Jenga-Unity
Description:
Simple unity physics based jenga. It has no UI, so you have to restart it using Alt+F4. I made it just for fun, and it was fun for first 15 minutes.
There are also some other objects on the table that can fall as you destroy Jenga tower.
At this moment game is unbalanced and it's hard to move more than 4 blocks without breaking the tower.
